#We have a dictionary of the specific events that Italy has won medals in and the number of medals they have won for each event. Assign to the variable "events" a list of keys from the dictionary medal_events. Do not hard code this.

medal_events = {'Shooting': 7, 'Fencing': 4, 'Judo': 2, 'Swimming': 3, 'Diving': 2}

#syntax goes like this 
for akey in medal_events.keys(): #the order in which we get the keys has not been defined
 events = list(medal_events.keys()) #listing all the keys using "list" function
print(events)
